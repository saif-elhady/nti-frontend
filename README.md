## Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:4200/`](http://localhost:4200/). The application supports hot reloading, so any changes made to the source files will automatically reflect in the browser.

## Code Scaffolding

To generate new Angular components or other building blocks, use the following command:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

You can also scaffold other Angular elements like directives, pipes, services, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules with similar commands.

## Build

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

The compiled build files will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests, use:

```bash
ng test
```

These tests will be executed through [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io), a test runner for JavaScript.

## Running End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end (e2e) tests, use:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Before using this command, make sure to install a suitable package for e2e testing, such as [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/) or [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Further Help

For additional help on the Angular CLI, use:

```bash
ng help
```
